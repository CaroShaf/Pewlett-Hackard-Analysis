# Pewlett-Hackard Retirement/Mentorship Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett-Hackard has had their employee databases scattered throughout departments and in separate databases, making it hard to evaluate the overall effect of retirements across
the organization.  The effect of the "silver tsunami" needs to be considered so that preparation for hiring, training and mentorship can sustain the organization through
transitions and potential loss of institutional knowledge. 

## Resources: 
pgAdmin v.4.30, PostgreSQL, VS Code, Excel 365

## Results: Major points from "Retiring Employees by Title" and "Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program"
Using SQL was a great way to query a large set of data, but the overwhelming amount of data makes it hard to grasp the trends.  So, a couple of quick Excel charts can give a quick peek at the numbers and trends.

Retirements by Department/Title Pie Chart [https://github.com/CaroShaf/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/master/retirementbydeptpiechart.png]
* Approximately 30% of the entire workforce will be retiring within the next few years, which amounts to over 90,000 workers.  Of these retirees, the overwhelming majority (over
80%) of them are either senior staff and technical/engineering positions.
* Positions for highly skilled/educated workers will be opening at a rapid pace.

Mentorship Eligibility Pivot Table []
* Only about 1% of the post-"silver tsunami" workforce will be eligible to serve as part-time mentors.  Giving the large number of retirements across all departments, it is
critical to recruit these mentors to assist with transition.  
* It might make the most sense for mentors in each title to be mentors for incoming employees at their own levels, but in the case of, say, senior engineers, there may be fewer
incoming senior engineers than assistant engineers.  In this case, it might make sense for senior engineers to help mentor at all levels.  It may be prudent to advance some mid
level engineers to senior engineer at this point, too, and perhaps even offer a full-time position rather than only a part-time mentorship.
* Mentors could be used to help recruit new staff, as well as mentor more than one new employee at a time.


## Summary
Every position across the organization will be affected by the large number of retirements.  All departments and roles will be affected.  Preparing for nearly 30% of the
workforce retiring cannot be over-prepared for.

At this time, it would be difficult to imagine this small number of mentors per new/existing employees being able to absorb all of the responsibilities of training and
orientation of replacements.  A radical restructuring, temporary workforce, or consultants hired for various recruitment and training needs will likely be necessary.  

Furthermore, the financial analysis of retirement benefits is not possible with the current salaries database.  This, too, will have a large effect on future hires when it is
known.
